# Task: Modeling a Simple Online Library System
If you need help, here is the docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html
### Requirements:

- Books: title, author, publisher, publicationYear, ISBN, availability, borrower (user object), borrowedDate, genre, rating (1-5 stars), reviews (array of strings), language.
- Users: name, email, borrowedBooks (array of books), readingList (array of book IDs), membershipType (free, premium), joinedDate.
- Library: books array, users array, genres (array of strings),
    - Methods:
        - Add book
        - Search for books (by title, author, ISBN, genre)
        - Lend book
        - Return book
        - Register user
        - List user's borrowed books
        - Recommend books based on user's reading history and genre preferences
        - Generate library statistics (most borrowed books, most popular genres, etc.)


### Types to use:

- `Record`: Create a book record with many properties.
- `Partial`: When adding a new book, not all fields are required.
- `Readonly`: Make the book's ISBN read-only.
- `Pick`: Display only the title and author of a book in a list.
- `Omit`: Exclude the borrower-related information when listing all books.
- `Exclude`: Filter books by genre from a union type representing all library items.
- `NonNullable`: Ensure that a book's title is not null or undefined.
- `Parameters` and `ReturnType`: Create a function to format book details as a string.
- `InstanceType`: Create a Library class and use InstanceType to get its instance type.
- `ThisType`: In a method that modifies a book, ensure this refers to a Library instance.
- `Mapped Types`: Create a type that maps a string literal type to another type, for example, to map genres to an array of books.
- `Conditional Types`: Create a type that checks if a given type is a subtype of another type.
- `Infer`: Infer the type of a generic parameter based on the usage.
- `Template Literal Types`: Create string literal types based on other types.
- `Indexed Access Types`: Access properties of an object using a computed key.
- `Utility Types`: Use `ReadonlyArray`, `Partial`, `Required`, and other utility types to create more complex types.

# Additional Features:

- Reviews: Allow users to leave reviews for books.
- Recommendations: Implement a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- Hold requests: Allow users to place holds on unavailable books.
- Notifications: Send email notifications for overdue books, new arrivals, and recommended books.

# Tips:

- Classes: Use classes to represent Book and User.
- Interfaces: Define interfaces to describe relationships between different entities.
- Generic types: Use generic types if you want to handle multiple types of documents.
